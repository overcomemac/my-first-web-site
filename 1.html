<h2>COME OUT AND PLAY lyrics</h2> 
show me what you could make her <strong>you'll never know <u>until you try it</u> </strong>
you don't have to keep it quiet and i know it makes you nervous 
But i promise you, it's worth it To show'em everything you kept inside 
<strong>Don't hide, Don't hide</strong>

<p>Hmm, hmm
Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty?
When we talk, you say it softly
<br><br>But I love it when you're awfully quiet, quiet
You see a piece of paper</br>
Could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it 
You don't have to keep it quiet
And I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away</p>
<p>Come out and play
    Look up, out of your window
    See snow, won't let it in though
    Leave home, feel the wind blow
    'Cause it's colder here inside in silence
    You don't have to keep it quiet
    Yeah, I know it makes you nervous
    But I promise you, it's worth it
    To show 'em everything you kept inside
    Don't hide, don't hide
    Too shy to say but I hope you stay
    Don't hide away
    Come out and play</p>
