show me what you could make her <strong>you'll never know <u>until you try it</u> </strong>
you don't have to keep it quiet and i know it makes you nervous 
But i promise you, it's worth it To show'em everything you kept inside 
<strong>Don't hide, Don't hide</strong><img src="coding.jpg" width="100%">

<p>Hmm, hmm
Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty?
When we talk, you say it softly
<br>But I love it when you're awfully quiet, quiet
You see a piece of paper</br>
Could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it 
You don't have to keep it quiet
And I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
</p>
